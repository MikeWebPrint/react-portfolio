  ## Description
  
  This project is a personal portfolio page built using React.js. This portfolio is primarily a refactored project, earlier built with plain HTML and CSS as a single HTML document.  The updated project is a React application incorporating React Router Dom for page routes. My goal was to sufficiently replicate my existing portfolio page to a working app. Once this is completed (contact form is not functional on the back end) I plan on incorporating CSS Grid for layout. Content will be updated as my skills grow!
